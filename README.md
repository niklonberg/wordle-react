# Wordle React App

This is the first challenge project Joshua Comeau's **Joy of React** course.  
The challenge was to create Wordle game, and practice with setting up a basic react app,  
creating components, passing props, and conditional rendering.

All html structure, components, logic, react state management and scss styling made by myself.
